### Read Me ###

### Note ###
Hello,
I have created this Python project as a way to help me learn the 
language, Github, AI, and data science. As a student at UW-Milwaukee
I am excited to take on new challenges when it comes to these fields. 
I hope that through these endeavors I can refine my skills in order
to land an internship in the coming months. The idea for this project 
was to help my current employer understand 
what their customers wanted to hear. The songs uploaded to songs.csv 
were all chosen and paid for by the patrons at Michiel's Dome Lanes.
I hope you find this project as interesting as I did.
Best, 
Ethan Schoen
